## Projects
## Intrusion Detection and Prevention System Implementation 

Installed and configured Snort, OSSEC, and Suricata on a Linux server. Developed and implemented security rules and
policies to detect and prevent network and host-based attacks. Conducted ongoing testing and fine-tuning to ensure
system effectiveness.

## Proactive Threat-hunting with Zeek and Rita 

Analyzed network logs collected with Zeek and Rita to identify potential security threats. Utilized Zeek's network
traffic analysis capabilities to detect anomalous patterns and suspicious behavior. Leveraged Rita's threat-hunting
framework to investigate potential indicators of compromise (IOCs).

## Incident Response Investigation with Velociraptor

Installed and configured Velociraptor on Kali Linux and a client on Windows. Conducted investigations into potential
PUP and botnet activity using Velociraptor's capabilities. Analyzed findings and took appropriate remediation actions.
Successfully identified and contained a PUP infection impacting Windows machines.
